//	Expand the Results class so that there is now a pass mark of 60%; 
//	if the person receives under 60% they get a fail message.
}

// Expand the previous example so that even if the person gets higher 
//than 60% overall, if they fail 1 or more of the exams 
//(pass grade of 60% for each exam) they still fail overall.
//eg. if a student's scores were: Biology: 150, Chemistry: 150, Physics: 84
//they would have an overall grade of 85.3% (Pass)
//but in this case the student would fail because their physics grade is 54% (Fail)
